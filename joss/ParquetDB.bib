  abstract = {In silico prediction of plant performance is gaining increasing breeders' attention. Several statistical, mathematical and machine learning methodologies for analysis of phenotypic, omics and environmental data typically use individual or a few data layers. Genomic selection is one of the applications, where heterogeneous data, such as those from omics technologies, are handled, accommodating several genetic models of inheritance. There are many new high throughput Next Generation~ Sequencing (NGS) platforms on the market producing whole-genome data at a low cost. Hence, large-scale genomic data can be produced and analyzed enabling~intercrosses and ~fast-paced~recurrent selection.  The offspring properties can be~predicted instead of manually~evaluated in the~field . Breeders have a short time window to make decisions by the time they receive data,  which~is one of the major challenges in commercial breeding. To implement genomic selection routinely as part of breeding programs, data management systems and analytics capacity have therefore to be in order. The traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS), which are  designed  to store, manage and analyze large-scale data, offer appealing characteristics, particularly when they are upgraded with capabilities for working with binary large objects. In addition, NoSQL systems were considered effective tools for managing high-dimensional genomic data. MongoDB system, a document-based NoSQL database, was effectively used to develop web-based tools for visualizing and exploring genotypic information. The Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5), a member of the high-performance distributed file systems family, demonstrated superior performance with high-dimensional and highly structured data such as genomic sequencing data.},

In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple `for-loop' construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.},

This open dataset can be accessed through multiple channels for both interactive exploration and data mining. The Materials Project also seeks to create open-source platforms for developing robust, sophisticated materials analyses. Future efforts will enable users to perform ``rapid-prototyping'' of new materials in silico, and provide researchers with new avenues for cost-effective, data-driven materials design.}

  abstract = {Traditional data storage formats and databases often introduce complexities and inefficiencies that hinder rapid iteration and adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce ParquetDB, a Python-based database framework that leverages the Parquet file format's optimized columnar storage. ParquetDB offers efficient serialization and deserialization, native support for complex and nested data types, reduced dependency on indexing through predicate pushdown filtering, and enhanced portability due to its file-based storage system. Benchmarks show that ParquetDB outperforms traditional databases like SQLite and MongoDB in managing large volumes of data, especially when using data formats compatible with PyArrow. We validate ParquetDB's practical utility by applying it to the Alexandria 3D Materials Database, efficiently handling approximately 4.8 million complex and nested records. By addressing the inherent limitations of existing data storage systems and continuously evolving to meet future demands, ParquetDB has the potential to significantly streamline data management processes and accelerate research development in data-driven fields.},
